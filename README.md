We are going to do Exploratory Data Analysis on Consumer Price Index in India and we are going to use Machine learning to find the value of money for future years.A Consumer Price Index (CPI) is designed to measure the changes over time in general level of retail prices of selected goods and services that households purchase for the purpose of consumption. The CPI measures price changes by comparing, through time, the cost of a fixed basket of commodities. The basket is based on the expenditures of a target population in a certain reference period. Since the basket contains commodities of unchanging or equivalent quantity and quality, the index reflects only pure price. This index is an important economic indicator and is widely considered as a barometer of inflation, a tool for monitoring price stability and as a deflator in national accounts. The dearness allowance (DA) of Government employees and wage contracts between labour and employer is based on this index.
